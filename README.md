Class-Tracker
=============
This project was done for IT496 Android Application Development Class MNSU, Mankato.
This application will use location and time to alert user about their classes.

The idea of this project was generated from alarms going off in classes. I often get disturbed because of forgeting that I have an alarm for that class.
So I thought of an intelligent alarm system which will see the location of the user before alerting the user and use appropriate alert.

Current version alerts user at the specified time by checking the location of the user and the class.
The alert is either sound and/or just shows the page displaying the distance. This depends on if the user is more than 20m from destination.
< 20m Display
> 20m Sound + display

Future phases will try to include maps and also possibly routes for the current location to destination.
